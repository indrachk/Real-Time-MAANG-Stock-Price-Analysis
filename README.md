# Google Cloud Data Pipeline Architechture - End to End with orchastraction
# Overview
Our project aimed to develop a data-driven solution to address the complexities of analyzing the historical stock prices of MAANG companies (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and identify the market conditions and external factors that could help make informed investment decisions. We used various cloud tools and technologies to build an efficient and scalable data pipeline, such as:

Kaggle API to retrieve the updated MAANG stocks dataset from Kaggle, which updates daily. 
You can check out the dataset here: MAANG Stock Prices Dataset
Google Cloud Storage to store the extracted files temporarily4
Google Cloud Functions to transform the data using Python scripts
Cloud PostgreSQL to load the data into three tables based on daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies
DataStream to capture the changes in the PostgreSQL database and move them into BigQuery

Tableau to create a dashboard with various KPI metrics and visualizationsOur project aimed to develop a data-driven solution to address the complexities of analyzing the historical stock prices of MAANG companies (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and identify the market conditions and external factors that could help make informed investment decisions.
